#Crowd_Frame_Server

Easy and fast way to deploy a server for receiving, preprocess and store requests from workers using [Crowd_Frame](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488560.3502182 "Crowd_Frame"). This repo was created and used during my intership at [SMDC Lab](http://smdc.uniud.it/smdc/ "SMDC Lab") of the University of Udine.
